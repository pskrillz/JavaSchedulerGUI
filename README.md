# uSchedule v1.0



The purpose of this application is to fulfill the exact requirements<br>
of a fictional, international consultancy agency. This application acts like a CRM software, <br>
with the ability to add, update, and delete customers and appointments. When an appointment  <br>
is created, they are assigned to specific customers and contacts within the organization. <br>
A reports function allows one to view appointment statistics and generate schedules for <br>
organization contacts.

To use the application, clone the github repo, set the root folder as source, and create <br>
a build configuration that points to the main class, "sample.Main".<br>
Then download and add JavaFX and Mysql dependencies to project modules <br>
and you're ready to build and run the application.  

Upon running the application a login window displays, <br> 
the default login info is username: "test", password: "test".<br>

Upon successful login, there will be a main UI view showing the list of all customers <br>
by default. There will be three tabs on the top of the window that allow you to <br>
navigate between customers view, appointments view, and the reports view, which <br>
provides the ability to generate schedules or calculate appointment statistics. <br>
